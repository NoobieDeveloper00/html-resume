                     <p>When I was 7 my father took me to the local swimming pool and ever since then I have loved water.
                        However, due to one reason or the other there have always been breaks and till date I can only do freestyle and
                        breathstroke. I plan to keep on swimming for the rest of my life.

                    My JEE preperation finally ended after three long years and was looking for things to do.
                    I wanted to associate music to my life because my uncle is a singer and there has been a teeny-tiny muscial
                    background ever since. One reason is also that I knew Albert Einstein played the violin and he WAS the smartest person, so 
                    in order to be *smarter* I chose to play the violin. &#128513;

                    The first anime I watched as teenager was One Punch Man and I absolutely loved it. After that I watched vaious other
                    anime covering a vast range of genres, basically I became an anime 'weeb'. One of the anime I watch is
                     One Piece and; boy oh boy! I have never seen anything better.

                    I started reading when I was in class 10th the first novel i read was 'Sidney Sheldon's The Silent Widow' by
                    Tilly Bagshawe. It was a crime thriller and i absolutely loved it and discovered that reading books was so much
                    better for me than watching movies and after that I never looked back and read various masterieces by genius authors from
                    around the world.
